0:04 
So next up, we have Dr. 
0:05 
Nir Barzilai. 
0:08 
Dr. Barzilai 
0:09 
is a founding director of the Institute for Aging Research 
0:13 
at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. 
0:16 
He's a director of the Paul F Glenn's Center for the Biology of Human 
0:19 
Aging Research and the National Institutes of Health's Nathan Shock centers. 
0:25 
He also discovered the longevity gene in humans. 
0:28 
So that's quite important. 
0:30 
Dr. Barzilai. 
0:37 
I thought the average age here is 68 and I don't see it. 
0:42 
You look so much younger, you know. 
0:45 
Well, first of all, thank you, Aviv, for this opportunity and 
0:50 
and for me, you're, you know, you're the people who spread the gospels. 
0:54 
I think we were expecting a very different life from now on. 
0:59 
And this is the day that you have to decide. 
1:02 
You want to spend your time in sick care or do you want to spend time 
1:06 
in health care, in maximizing your health, as you heard from Eric with 
1:12 
with the exercise and diet and sleep and social connectivity. 
1:18 
And so 
1:21 
this is I'll just bring you to my life with this following story. 
1:25 
There's a 100 year old gentleman that walks into life insurance 
1:29 
and he wants life insurance and the clerk says, 
1:33 
100 years old, we don't give life insurance. 
1:35 
That's not true because my mother is insured here. 
1:38 
So how old is your mother? 
1:39 
She's hundred and 20 and she's fine. 
1:43 
So the clerk goes back, they talk to the boss 
1:46 
and they said, that's a great marketing. 
1:48 
You know, 
1:49 
we should give him life insurance and we'll, you know, 
1:52 
we can make something out of it. 
1:54 
So they come to the old gentleman and says, you know, 
1:57 
we're going to give you a life insurance. 
1:58 
In fact, come on Tuesday and we have everything ready, you can just sign. 
2:03 
They said, I'm sorry, I'm busy on Tuesday. 
2:06 
And they say, old man, what do you have on Tuesday? 
2:08 
Said, on Tuesday, my grandfather is getting married. 
2:15 
(laughter) How old? 
2:15 
How old is your grandfather? 
2:17 
He said 150. 
2:21 
150 and he wants to get married? 
2:22 
He said he doesn't want to, but his parents are putting lots of pressure 
2:29 
(laughter) 
2:30 
So you'll understand why. 
2:33 
This is my life and this is my horizon. 
2:36 
And I would tell you, whenever we are thinking of life like that, 
2:39 
they're trade offs, right? 
2:41 
Do you really want to be 150 year old and your in-laws 
2:45 
or mothers will tell you what to do? 
2:46 
You know, 
2:49 
There's going to be trade-offs. 
2:51 
And I also want to say I have, 
2:56 
thanks to Aviv, intervention 
2:59 
hyperbaric chamber for mice in my lab. 
3:05 
So just like if you go for that, 
3:08 
you can have an after work drink 
3:11 
a Eric said what he thinks about drinks, but I'm not going to talk about it now. 
3:16 
What I really want to talk about 
3:18 
is this incredible fact that in 100,000 years or so of human 
3:23 
evolution, life expectancy was between 20 and 30 years. 
3:29 
Okay? 
3:29 
It's only in the last hundred and 50 years. 
3:31 
That's why it looks so steep that we made this progress. 
3:35 
Okay. 
3:36 
So when people are coming to me and say, I have a prostate stuff, why didn't 
3:40 
evolution figure out? Well, evolution needs those 100,000 years to work. 
3:45 
But if people didn't get prostate problem 
3:48 
when they were 20, 30 we cannot solve it now. 
3:51 
Okay. Think also, you guys 
3:55 
not how rare 
3:56 
you would have been during human evolution, 
3:59 
but how many people do you think during 
4:02 
evolution were married for more than 30 years? 
4:05 
If life expectancy was 20 or 30? 
4:07 
Right. You're the world holder. 
4:10 
You're here, you're doing great. 
4:12 
Really great. 
4:14 
But this is the point 
4:17 
we got old 
4:19 
and we started getting age related disease. 
4:21 
We get the first disease and a treatment and the second disease and a treatment. 
4:25 
And eventually we end up with bad quality of life. 
4:31 
And what we have done 
4:33 
in those first hundred and 50 years, 
4:37 
a lot of what we have done has been prevention, 
4:40 
just harnessing agriculture so there's enough food, 
4:43 
cleaning the water, building sewers, a vaccination. 
4:48 
Right. A lot of it was prevention. Yeah. 
4:50 
We also invented antibiotics and surgery. 
4:53 
Okay. 
4:55 
But it's thinking of the prevention 
4:58 
that really makes us think 
5:01 
that there is a new 
5:04 
we can create a new history here, 
5:06 
because if we prevent the aging process before 
5:10 
the disease happened, then we've done a lot of things. 
5:14 
Right. 
5:15 
So if I have to summarize things that Eric 
5:18 
basically said before or how the field, in my words, 
5:23 
is that first of all, aging as a biology, we all know that, okay? 
5:27 
We all know that aging is a biology. 
5:29 
I think what we don't realize 
5:32 
is that this biology is what drives the diseases. 
5:36 
Okay? 
5:37 
You can be born with genes of Alzheimer. 
5:40 
There's this APOE4 if you heard, if you have both copies of the gene, 
5:44 
you're likely to get Alzheimer when you're 60 or 70 and be dead when you're 80. 
5:48 
But when you are born, you're not demented. 
5:51 
Then when we're your one year or ten year or 50 years, you're not demented. 
5:55 
You need this biology of aging to bring on the diseases. 
5:59 
And so that's why we're talking prevention. 
6:01 
You have to do it then 
6:03 
and the 
6:04 
good news is that aging can be targeted. 
6:08 
We've done it in animals. 
6:10 
We've done it in humans with a variety of tools. 
6:14 
And we've showed that aging can be delayed or stopped 
6:18 
or even reversed in several instances. 
6:22 
And if you're asking but what is it? 
6:25 
What is the biology? 
6:27 
I'm really not going to tell you in a 20 minute presentation what's the biology? 
6:31 
But just that, you know, for your eyes 
6:34 
that we have what's called the hallmarks of aging. 
6:37 
Okay, We kind of agree. 
6:39 
We neuroscientists agree those are the hallmarks of aging. 
6:43 
And to be a hallmark of aging, you have to show that something goes wrong 
6:46 
when you're old. 
6:47 
And if you fix it again in animals or humans, you get healthspan 
6:51 
most important health span and also lifespan extension. 
6:57 
And as I said, 
6:58 
targeting those hallmarks 
7:02 
improve lifespan and health span of animal. 
7:06 
But this is the thing 
7:09 
you don't have to deal with all of them at the same time. 
7:14 
That's why there are those lines going in between. 
7:17 
You can hit one of them and correct all of the other or most of the others. 
7:23 
And this is kind of the promise that we have now. 
7:26 
And we can test drugs by their ability to target those hallmarks. 
7:32 
And if they don't hit all or many of those hallmarks, 
7:35 
they are not really going to effect aging the way we want them to affect it. 
7:41 
So, we wrote a paper 
7:45 
and then a correction to a paper 
7:48 
where we took all the FDA approved drugs. 
7:52 
Okay. 
7:53 
Now, when I'm seeing FDA approved drugs, those drugs 
7:56 
have been approved for some use, so they're safe. 
8:00 
Okay. 
8:00 
We know everything about their safety, but we took all those drugs that were given 
8:05 
to animals to test some hypotheses, extended lifespan in animals. 
8:10 
And we took all the data that we had. 
8:13 
And you see on the right side, we have a scale that is up to 12 
8:19 
that looks at, you know, the hallmarks of aging in animals 
8:24 
and also what happens to humans. 
8:27 
And you see that there are a five drugs 
8:31 
that get scores between ten and 12. 
8:35 
In other words, those are drugs 
8:37 
that are approved by FDA for another purpose. 
8:41 
But if you take them for aging, 
8:43 
you might actually really target the biology, the biology of aging. 
8:48 
And I'll give one of them as an example. 
8:51 
The point is, and Eric said it, we don't sell drugs here, okay? 
8:57 
But any doctor can repurpose 
8:59 
any FDA approved drug and many have done it. 
9:03 
And they've done it mainly to a drug that's called metformin. 
9:08 
And metformin is the cheapest drug in the US formulary. 
9:12 
Okay, It's really cheap. 
9:14 
You can get it for more expensive in Amazon. 
9:17 
It would cost you a dollar a day, but it's really a $0.20 drug most 
9:22 
or if you get it from Mexico metformin is even cheaper 
9:27 
and there to 
9:28 
to kind of evidence that you have to do about metformin 
9:31 
the first one that is really important for me 
9:34 
it showed to target all of 
9:39 
the hallmarks of aging and people are saying, oh really? 
9:43 
How does one drug do the whole all hallmarks of aging? 
9:46 
and this is how we understand it. 
9:51 
There are some drugs that are going to target aging, 
9:57 
which means they're going 
9:58 
to take your old cell or old organ or old body and make it younger. 
10:02 
And by that it's going to improve a lot of things. 
10:05 
Other hallmarks. 
10:07 
Okay. 
10:07 
So that's what it's doing on very principle way. 
10:12 
And the reason we know that it's doing because metformin has been out there 
10:17 
for decades, actually for 70 or almost 80 years, by the way, it was used 
10:22 
initially to treat 
10:26 
it's an excerpt of the French lilac, but it's modulated. 
10:29 
So it's not nutraceutical, but it was used to treat arthritis and to prevent flu. 
10:34 
And then it was discovered that it lowers glucose in diabetics. 
10:37 
So it went to diabetes. 
10:39 
And in diabetes people have noticed that it's doing really well. 
10:43 
Why is it doing well? 
10:44 
First of all, in non-diabetic people, it will prevent diabetes. 
10:49 
It prevent heart disease, it prevents cancer, it 
10:52 
prevents cognitive decline and prevents mortality. 
10:56 
The most important and really convincing 
10:59 
data recently was from a study, a clinical study. 
11:03 
So it's a controlled study. 
11:04 
Or let let me say differently, nine studies around the world during 
11:10 
COVID have showed that people in metformin have less hospitalizations and deaths. 
11:15 
So in the United States, they they had a controlled study 
11:19 
where they took not diabetic people 
11:22 
and they gave them metformin within three days of a positive COVID, 
11:27 
and it decreased hospitalization by more than 40%, death 
11:30 
by more than 40% and long COVID by more than 40%. 
11:35 
And this just shows you why those drugs are important, because it's not diabetes. 
11:40 
It it's not metabolism. 
11:41 
It's also immunology. Right. 
11:44 
It improves your immune function. 
11:46 
And maybe it's improved other things because COVID is a severe disease. 
11:49 
It gives you the ability to fight the disease. 
11:52 
So there is a lot of evidence to use. 
11:55 
Use a it for me 
11:58 
and you might ask then why is metformin 
12:03 
not official target in aging? 
12:06 
And the reason is that the FDA 
12:09 
doesn't recognize aging as a preventable condition. 
12:13 
And if that happens, health 
12:15 
care providers don't have to pay you. 
12:18 
And if that happens, pharmaceuticals 
12:21 
that can develop better drugs, combination of drugs 
12:24 
and other drugs are not going to jump in because they need a business plan. 
12:28 
Okay. 
12:29 
And that's why what we're leading as a group, 
12:33 
the American Federation of Aging Research leads a group 
12:38 
that's called We're going to do this study 
12:41 
and we're going to show in a controlled study double line control 
12:46 
that we're going to in one study 
12:49 
to prevent a cluster of age related disease. 
12:51 
Of course, cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognition, mortality. 
12:56 
We're working with the FDA. 
12:57 
We asked the FDA, is that okay? 
12:59 
They said, well, you should do some changes. 
13:01 
We made some changes and we're going to launch this study now. 
13:05 
Okay. 
13:06 
But but you have to understand, we have it. 
13:10 
Everybody has to be on board and we have to have this study. 
13:13 
So nobody will say, you didn't prove anything for me. 
13:17 
We've proved everything because in different studies we showed 
13:20 
what the cluster will do, but we have to do the cluster 
13:24 
in order for the FDA to say, you know, maybe, maybe you're right. 
13:28 
Okay, 
13:29 
is metformin the only drug? 
13:32 
So now I'll go back and connect it to the 100 years old and and by the way, 
13:38 
I appreciated how many of you want to be a hundred years old. 
13:42 
So I'll I'll talk about my study in a 
13:48 
those are the poster child of my study. 
13:50 
Those are four siblings that were born between 1910 and 1920 in New York. 
13:57 
And what happened to them? 
14:00 
All of them 
14:02 
reached over the age of 102, 
14:04 
in fact, with their little sister on the right died. 
14:07 
They were shocked. 
14:08 
Okay. 
14:09 
The other is 
14:12 
the other sister, the older sister standing on the left, 
14:15 
on the left, Helen, who died at 110. 
14:20 
I met her first time in a New York apartment when she was 100 years old. 
14:26 
She opened the door. 
14:28 
She was smoking a cigarette. 
14:31 
I said, 
14:32 
Helen, nobody told you to stop smoking. 
14:35 
And she said, The four doctors told me to stop smoking. 
14:38 
They died. (laughter) 
14:42 
Those guys, I have 750 like that. 
14:46 
Okay, Those guys, 
14:48 
60% of men, 30% of women were smokers. 
14:51 
obesity or overweight, 
14:54 
more than 50% exercising, even housework, 
14:59 
walking less than 50%, 2% vegetarian. 
15:03 
They didn't do what they had to do. 
15:06 
And the point here is we talked about 
15:09 
environment is a major thing for you, but not for 100 years old. 
15:14 
Okay. 
15:15 
With Helen, the conversation, well 
15:17 
if you stop smoking, maybe you live 120 years. 
15:20 
Okay. 
15:22 
But they were not people who were interacting with their environment. 
15:27 
And that's why they're so special for us, because something slowed their aging. 
15:33 
And how did it slow the aging 
15:36 
is what one of the things actually it was very important 
15:41 
for us from the beginning to ask, did they get sick when everybody gets sick? 
15:46 
And now they're just living with the disease longer, 
15:49 
they're sick longer, or is their lifespan and health span? 
15:53 
Did it go together? 
15:55 
And what you see here on the graph 
15:58 
that initially everyone don't have a disease. 
16:03 
The scale is disease free survival. 
16:06 
So everybody is okay. 
16:07 
And then you go with the green group. 
16:09 
The green group 
16:11 
are what we call our control, that they are age of their kids, actually, okay? 
16:15 
They're like regular people. 
16:17 
And after the age of 60, they start to accumulate diseases. 
16:20 
And at age 80, only 10% of them don't have a disease. 
16:25 
But you see that the centenarians, they're free of disease 20, 30 years longer. 
16:31 
Okay. So this is for me. 
16:32 
This is what we're trying to do. 
16:34 
We're trying to increase health span. 
16:37 
The side effect will be increased lifespan. 
16:40 
But we have population that can do it. 
16:42 
It's with within our ability as humans. 
16:44 
We actually think that we have the ability to live, 
16:47 
at least statistically, 250 years. 
16:50 
There's a woman that was 122 years, but we have this capacity 
16:54 
and we're dying here in the United States to be below the age of 76. 
16:58 
Okay. 
16:59 
So those centenarians live longer, they're healthier. 
17:02 
But that's not actually the interesting thing. 
17:06 
They have what 
17:07 
we called a contraction of morbidity. 
17:10 
They are sick very little time at the end of their lives. 
17:14 
Okay. 
17:14 
You see that even the centenarians who are 100 years old, 30% of them, 
17:19 
don't have any disease and some of them will just not wake up one morning. 
17:24 
Okay. 
17:25 
But they spend very little time if at all, being sick. 
17:30 
And this is very important because even the CDC now, 
17:35 
we all know what's the CDC 
17:38 
showed that the medical cost 
17:41 
in the last two years of somebody who dies over the age of 100 
17:44 
is a third of those who die when they are 70. 
17:48 
Okay. So we know that it's true. 
17:50 
And then comes this Professor Andrew Scott from 
17:54 
from who's the economist in the London School of Economy. 
17:56 
And he said, Guys, you’re out of your mind 
17:59 
what you what you're measuring, you're measuring. 
18:01 
So they're not in the hospital. 
18:03 
But if they're not in the hospital, what are they doing? 
18:05 
What are you guys doing? 
18:07 
You're traveling, you're shopping. 
18:10 
You're building houses for your your kids. 
18:14 
There is an economical value of not being sick that we forget some time. 
18:19 
And he calculate that this economy volume 
18:22 
value is $39 trillion. 
18:25 
If we affect-- a year, if we affect healthspan by a year or two. 
18:30 
Okay. 
18:31 
So we cannot afford not to do that. 
18:34 
I would tell you that one of our major initiatives these days 
18:40 
is and we started it, it's 
18:42 
it's called the Super Ager Initiative, the Super Ager Family Study. 
18:46 
It's led by American Federation for Aging Research. 
18:50 
And we're trying to get 10,000 centenarians and their families 
18:54 
in 750 centenarians, 
18:56 
we discovered a longevity 
19:00 
genes of which two are already went to a, 
19:04 
By the way, I should explain that when we find the genes, okay, 
19:09 
we can do something about it, not for the centenarians, but for others. 
19:14 
Okay. 
19:15 
When we find what's the gene, we see the mechanism. 
19:18 
And usually what we do is we develop a drug. 
19:21 
Two thirds of the FDA-approved drugs last year were based on genetic study. 
19:26 
So we want the genetics of the people who slows aging 
19:31 
so much that they live 40% more than then their friends. 
19:35 
Right This is what we want. There are several. 
19:38 
There's not one of them, but all of them are druggable. 
19:41 
And we'll have to find which drug is good for which people. 
19:45 
But that that could be done. 
19:47 
So if you know any centenarians, please register them on the web. 
19:52 
And what we do is we send them a kit 
19:54 
and they spit into the kit and then we have their data and we find 
19:58 
genes in there, their and and their families. 
20:02 
Okay. 
20:03 
I want to take it a notch farther and just talk a little bit 
20:08 
about how how this biology looks in the lab 
20:12 
and what I'm showing you now 
20:15 
is that we measured 5000 proteins 
20:19 
of the blood of a thousand people between the ages 65 and 95. 
20:25 
And we asked what changes between 65 and 95? 
20:29 
Okay, those are a lot of proteins, 5000 time, thousand proteins. 
20:34 
So we put them in this mountain where 
20:37 
there are computers in and they throw out lava stones. 
20:41 
Those are the red dots that you see. 
20:44 
The higher it goes, the more statistical it is. 
20:49 
And the statistics here are ten to the -80. 
20:52 
Okay? It's very highly statistical. 
20:54 
And the farther it goes to the left and the right is more effect it is. 
20:57 
Now, those that go, 
20:59 
the lava stones that go to the right, they increase and those that go to the 
21:04 
is decrease because your protein when you age, go both direction. 
21:08 
Some of them you're losing, some of them you're gaining, 
21:10 
some of them are good, some of them are bad. 
21:13 
it's a whole, it's a whole other thing 
21:18 
But what we've done in 
21:21 
a Nature paper that was published last week, 
21:26 
we found out 
21:29 
not only what are the proteins, what's the total 
21:33 
that determine your biological age, but also where they're coming from. 
21:38 
A lot of that is breakdown of tissues. 
21:42 
So where are those proteins coming from? 
21:45 
Some are coming from the brains and some from the liver and some from the kidney. 
21:50 
And when we do that, we see the generally the age of your liver 
21:55 
is like the age of your whole body 80% of the time. 
22:00 
But sometimes we see that your kidneys aging faster 
22:05 
than the rest of their body or your brain is aging faster. 
22:10 
And so maybe we should look at the brain, and maybe 
22:13 
that's where your aging is led by. 
22:16 
And maybe that's where we need to interfere, 
22:18 
intervene first, and maybe there are better drugs 
22:21 
for the brain and others, for the kidney or for your heart. 
22:25 
Okay. So this is where 
22:29 
the research, it is highly AI 
22:33 
there's a lot of data coming in, 
22:36 
but we've become really good at that. 
22:39 
And we're accelerating our our discoveries. 
22:44 
So can we develop general therapeutics? 
22:47 
We do. 
22:48 
And we have developed gerotherapeutics and those gerotherapeutics 
22:52 
in the next few years will be validated, will get blessing of the FDA 
22:58 
and will enable us to stunt 
23:01 
your aging much more effectively. 
23:04 
As I said, the results of centenarians 
23:07 
have been translated into drugs. 
23:14 
Where do we stand now on other parts of aging? 
23:18 
I'll just make really several small, 
23:23 
but what you see on the left side 
23:26 
is the three major category that we're dealing with. 
23:30 
One is what I describe as compression of morbidity with the 
23:34 
with the example of metformin. 
23:37 
The other 
23:38 
is reversing aging, which by the way, we call it Dorian Gray. 
23:42 
Dorian Gray stopped aging. 
23:44 
But when he looked at the mirror, he saw his right age. 
23:48 
Okay. 
23:50 
When I'm looking at Zoom, I'm saying, that's the Dorian age. 
23:54 
I'm much younger. But, you know, 
23:57 
reversing aging is the, Wolverine or the fountain of youth. 
24:02 
It's not happening and it's not happening soon. 
24:04 
But there are drugs that are being developed 
24:08 
that are going to make you healthier, even if they're not going 
24:12 
to extend your lifespan so much, but they're going to make a difference. 
24:16 
So we're making it's called senolytics. 
24:18 
We're making a program with them and then and I'm talking 
24:22 
50 years from now, there's the Forever Young, the Peter Pan. 
24:28 
Okay. 
24:29 
And with Peter Pan, we're making some progress, but not in whole body. 
24:34 
The idea is, is that you'll come when you're 20 years old 
24:40 
and you'll get the treatment 
24:42 
and you repeat the treatment every few months or every few years. 
24:46 
And it will stand you know, it will reverse your aging enough 
24:50 
so that you can live healthier without growing old. 
24:54 
For me, it's 50 years away, okay? 
24:57 
Because I don't want to be alive to see what happens 
25:01 
and to be blamed if it's not or. 
25:03 
Yes, but it's really happening, in the sense 
25:06 
that in organ-specific ways and in animals, we're making progress. 
25:11 
And I'm sure that some of it will be okay. 
25:15 
Let let me explain it in a different way. 
25:18 
I showed you we can measure biological aging. 
25:22 
We can take a sperm of a 90 year old man 
25:26 
or maybe the 100 year old man that that wants a life insurance 
25:30 
and fertilize an egg of a 50 year old woman. 
25:35 
And we will know the age of the egg and the sperm. 
25:41 
But when you form 
25:43 
a baby, the stem cells that form a baby, they go to zero. 
25:48 
They don't remember our aging. 
25:50 
They totally go to zero. 
25:52 
And then they start the clock. 
25:56 
So we figured out how to do it in our own body. 
25:59 
We have this biological capacity. 
26:02 
This biological capacity. 
26:04 
We want to really make relevant 
26:08 
for all of us in the future. 
26:11 
This is my hyperbaric chamber for mice and rats. 
26:15 
I didn't talk about it, 
26:17 
Could our kids and grandkids be healthy centenarians? 
26:23 
I think absolutely. 
26:25 
I also want to say that 
26:28 
this is not only about you guys. 
26:30 
It's not only about 
26:33 
getting old. 
26:36 
People who survived cancer, kids who survived cancer are aging rapidly. 
26:41 
What did we do? We give them radiation and chemotherapy. 
26:43 
We age them. 
26:44 
They get heart disease when they're 35 years old. 
26:49 
People who have 
26:49 
HIV getting disease ten years before their friends. 
26:53 
People are disabled because they cannot move because they eat so much. 
26:57 
You know, because they cannot exercise. Right. 
27:00 
They die sooner. 
27:02 
Or let's look at another extreme. 
27:05 
If we want to go to Mars, 
27:08 
we are not going to get there before we stop aging. It 
27:12 
with radiation, we’ll have cardiovascular disease, cancer 
27:17 
by the time we get to Mars and we're not going to come back. 
27:20 
So for all those reasons, we have to stop aging. 
27:24 
So wish us and you luck. 
27:26 
And thank you very much for listening.
