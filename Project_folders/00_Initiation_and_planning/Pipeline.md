# **Pipeline:**

Step 1\. Data retrieval:

1. APIs for Scientific Articles:  
   1. PubMed API (For biomedical research)  
   2. arXiv API (open-access scientific papers)  
   3. Semantic Scholar API (wide range of research papers)  
   4. CrossRef API (DOI-based paper research)  
2. Web Scraping  
   1. Use Scrapy or BeautifulSop for open-access journals.  
   2. Check on permissions and legal use.

Step 2\. Preprocessing and Storage:

1. Convert PDFs to text using pdfminer or PyMuPDF.  
2. Clean data (keep references, figures, etc.)  
3. Store in a structured format (maybe use a AWS or Azure Database)

Step 3\. NLP for Information Extraction:

1. Named Entity Recognition. Identify key terms like “Telomere length”, “Epigenetics”, MTor, etc  
2. Summarization. Use transformers (BART, T5 or Pegasus) to generate summaries.  
3. Keyword Extraction. Use TF-IDF, YAKE, or KeyBERT to highlight main topics.  
4. Relation Extraction: Train a model to detect causal links (e.g. “finding extends healthspan”)

Step 4\. Analysis and Insights:

1. Use vector databases (FAISS, ChromaDB) for semantic search.  
2. Build a chatbot or dashboard to query the findings.
