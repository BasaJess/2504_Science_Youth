He's the founding chair of the Wellness Institute at Cleveland Clinic as well. He's also the author of 
four New York Times number one 
0:18 
bestsellers, including the book The Great Age Reboot. Please welcome Dr. Michael Roizen. 
Opportunity of a Lifetime
0:30 
Thank you. I have I hope you guys are here for a long time because I have 3 hours worth of slides 
loaded. 
0:36 
And so we're going to go pretty fast. What I'm going to talk about is what I call 
0:44 
the opportunity of a lifetime, the chance that you will be able to be 40 again when your calendar strikes
90. 
0:54 
So I am always too early. In 1998, when we came out with Real age, 
1:01 
I said that 60 could be the new 40. You've heard Eric and Nir 
1:07 
talk about how that's really possible. I really believe that sometime in the next ten years 
1:14 
it will be very easy for you, in fact, to get to be 40 again. 
1:22 
That's with about an 80% probability as we'll go through. 
Why is this important
1:28 
Why is that so important? Well, this is what's happening to the workforce in the United States. 
1:35 
Down at the bottom. They told us not to turn around, but I can't help it down on this mine. 
1:40 
You see the people who are, if you will, retired. 
1:47 
And on this slide you see the people who are working. You'll notice that when in 1950 
1:55 
there were 6.6 workers supporting each of us. I'm not retired, but each of the retired people now. 
2:02 
In fact, there are less than four. And over the next years that goes to 2.7. 
2:09 
In the United States, it can't happen, meaning 2.7 can't converge, can't support, 
The Human Genome Project
2:17 
if you will, one person who's retired in the same style. 
2:22 
So we've got to get something that increases the workers to a longer age, and that's what longevity will 
do. 
2:31 
This started with the Human Genome Project when it started they expected to find 
2:38 
300,000 genes based on the amount of DNA in your nucleus. 
2:43 
They found only 22,500. All genes do, by the way, is make proteins or watch other genes. 
2:53 
So when you heard near talk about 5 or 10 thousand proteins, you actually have 
2:58 
genes that make around 20,000 proteins. And what was the rest of the DNA 
3:06 
it was initially called junk DNA by both of the investigators at the NIH and Craig Venter in private 
world. 
3:17 
And but seven years later, they found it was what we call 
3:22 
epi genes or switches that turn your genes on or off. 
3:28 
You have more switches than you do genes and you control those switches. 
3:37 
If you take nothing away from today. From what I'm saying is, remember, your actions matter because. 
3:45 
You control the switches that control your proteins. 
3:51 
And as you heard Eric speak, 
3:57 
93% in the most recent studies, twin studies 
4:02 
of which of your genes are on or not are under your control. So I'm going to keep repeating this slide. 
4:10 
Your genes make your proteins, and those proteins make you, and you control your genes. 
4:17 
That is why you can have such a strong do over, if you will. 
4:23 
You are the best genetic engineer for you that we know of. 
4:30 
As I said, 300,000 They expected to find. 22,500 they found. 
4:38 
The rest of it is stuff you control. Here's what stress management does. This is what's called the heat 
map. 
4:45 
So up and down our gene, they're the ones you take from the buccal, 
4:50 
Probably many of you have done Ancestry or me or one of those other gene programs. 23 and me. 
4:56 
You took a swab. This is what happens from the swab. You get a picture like this and this is 25 nurses, 
not 
5:04 
from the Cleveland Clinic where I'm from, but this is 25 nurses who hadn't gone through a stress 
management program. 
5:11 
They went through a stress management program between n1 and n2 This is 16 weeks later. 
5:16 
And M is a year later. Why is it called a heat map? Because where they're red, those genes are on. 
5:24 
So you see these genes are on they go through a stress management program and they largely turn them
off. 
5:29 
What these genes up here producing, they're producing inflammatory proteins. 
5:35 
You get to turn off your proteins that cause 
5:40 
by just doing stress management. 256 different genes you turn on or off 
5:47 
these that are often get turned on, they decrease inflammation in your body. 
5:52 
Who does that? You do it by your actions. Here is one of the favorites studies from Dean Ornish. 
Dean Ornish Study
6:01 
This is 52 guys with prostate cancer. And I don't know if you can see it, but these are largely red. 
6:07 
This is largely green, or off. They, over the years. So this is one-year difference. 
6:13 
Same 52 guys here, is on this side. They took these genes and turn them off. 
6:18 
What are these those are the RAS family of genes that promote the growth of breast, colon and prostate
cancer. 
6:24 
Here, where they turned them, they were off and turned them on. These two produce the GSTM1 
protein 
6:31 
that causes prostate, breast and colon cancers, to commit suicide. What did they do to do that? 
6:37 
The three guys who smoke quit smoking. all 52 eliminated five foods from their diet. 
6:43 
I'll get to what those are later. They did 15 minutes of walking a day, I'm sorry, 
6:50 
15 minutes of meditation a day, and they walk 10,000 steps a day. People accuse me of giving talks just
so I can walk. (laughter) 
7:00 
This, This guy was at Hopkins and got turned down for coronary artery bypass surgery because. 
7:08 
This is the left anterior descending artery. This is the main artery, the left main artery. 
7:14 
And this is called rati coronary artery disease rati because It's throughout. And you'll notice he doesn't 
have much collaterals. 
7:21 
He came to the Cleveland Clinic saying, you're the best. I want coronary artery surgery. He got turned 
down at our place too. 
7:28 
But he got to see a guy named Cardwell Esselstyn who said, 
7:33 
all you have to do is change your diet, walk 10,000 steps a day, meditate 15 minutes, morning and 
night. 
7:40 
And if you smoke and he did quit smoking, the guy said, I can't walk five steps without, chest pain. 
7:48 
So Esse said, you get a new job, you're walking five, five steps, 2000 times a day. (laughter) 
7:57 
He did that and that's his same X-ray machine, same technique. 
8:03 
Two and a half years later, this is before statins, etc.. You get to control your genes. 
8:09 
It isn't just a change in food because I don't want high cholesterol. 
8:16 
No, your changing which of your genes are on or not and that changes you. 
8:21 
You are a genetic engineer for you. Why you stress a muscle and why is that good for a brain? 
8:28 
You guys are so lucky you've got a Aviv here. They not only do the hyperbaric, but they do everything 
else in that program. 
8:36 
And one of it is to stress muscles. You guys can do that too, as you've heard. But what happens when 
you stress the muscle? 
8:44 
You turn on a gene that makes the protein Irisin Irisin goes to your brain and turns on another gene 
called brain 
8:52 
derived neurotrophic growth factor, which is like miracle-gro for your brain. It increases your 
hippocampal size 
9:00 
and you have less problems with memory. So one of the keys 
9:06 
that Aviv stresses is in fact physical activity and that all of, you know, the lifestyle of TheVillages is 
perfect 
9:14 
for that. Another thing 
Longevity
9:19 
I don't know why I've got this again. this one is you also stress your muscles. 
9:27 
It turns on another protein that makes GPLD-1 who cares about the name, 
9:34 
but that one makes your blood brain barrier much better. 
9:40 
So it stops inflammation from going to your brain and it gets rid of old proteins. 
9:47 
Why does the body do this? Who knows why it happened? How do we know it really did? 
9:52 
Because Harvard and M.I.T., UCSF tried to patent this, have a patent pending for this from the same 
day they're competing 
10:01 
because they think maybe one day we'll be able to give this protein to you. 
10:07 
In any case, the key point is your choices matter. 
10:13 
What you do matters to how long and well you live. You are genetic engineer for you. 
10:19 
Now, if you look at longevity, you heard from Nir that we were in the 20 range for millennia, 
10:26 
but starting in 1890 we've gone up two and a half years every ten years. 
10:32 
Women are always a higher life expectancy. They're blue here than men. 
10:37 
They live about three years longer and initially the increase of two and a half years per ten years was 
due to sanitation and things for kids. 
10:47 
Now it is the management of chronic disease such as high blood pressure and diabetes and valve 
diseases. 
10:54 
But we expect in the next. And by the way, before I go further on that, let me show you. 
11:02 
This is heart disease. And if you go back, if I can back, let's see. Yeah, sorry. 
11:08 
This is sorry. I'll get there. This is 
11:14 
the heart disease death rate from 1950 to 2019. 
11:21 
You'll notice it's decreasing. In fact, that's what the benefit of the blood 
11:27 
pressure pills and the statins and the other things are. If we had the same number of deaths 
11:32 
in 2019 or in 2023 as we had in 1950, we'd have 450,000 more deaths in the United States 
11:42 
and 55% reduction in heart disease because of the advances in science. 
11:48 
So when you reject statins, that's making a choice. That's making you older. 
11:55 
Let me repeat that. Don't believe everything you read on the Internet. Statins have made, and blood 
pressure pills have made a major benefit. 
12:04 
That's in every age group. The death rate has declined. Same thing with cancer. 
12:10 
If we had the same therapies for cancer last year as we did in 
12:16 
1992, we'd have 150,000 more deaths. We're advancing in medicine. 
12:23 
But you've got to help us. So that means, in fact, 
12:28 
we've continued to increase life expectancy of those population, ones that have done healthy choices. 
12:37 
That is, if you look at the course, at the pace where we have opioids and obesity. 
12:43 
But if you look at the coasts in America, we've still continued and the rest of the world has still 
continued to increase life expectancy. 
12:51 
But in the next ten years, we expect major jump, a 30 year jump. 
12:58 
So if you're 80 and expect to live to 90, you make it to 90. 
13:03 
Going to make it to 115. 
Exponential Change
13:09 
I love doing that. I'm going to do that again. That's a exponential jump. 
13:15 
Now, Peter Diamandis sauys an exponential jump 
13:21 
is in fact, if you take one linear step 
13:26 
or you take 30 linear steps, you get 30 yards closer to the goal line, you take 30 exponential steps 
13:34 
one, two, four, eight, 16, 32. You're 26 times around the earth. 
13:39 
That's how fast science is progressing. I can ask it to you another question. 
13:45 
Anyone know what it costs to do the first human genome and from either niche or private world, you 
know 
13:54 
how much it costs. Take a guess. Is $1 billion? Pretty damn good guess. 
13:59 
It actually costs $2.7 billion. Okay. What does it cost now to do that amount of your genome? 
14:08 
It's go ahead. You know what it costs now? You know, it costs 
14:14 
$100 regularly unless you get it on Mother's or Father's Day when Walmart has a special and it costs 
$70, that's exponential. 
14:24 
How fast science, It's gone from 3.7 billion to $70. 
14:30 
You can do your whole genome, which they didn't do in the Human Genome project for only $800. 
14:36 
Now that's exponential change and that's what we're about to see, we believe. 
14:42 
So if you're 75 now, when you were born, you were expected to live 60. 
14:48 
You've already passed your sell by date. But in fact, 
14:55 
the clock would say you're going to live to 82. Wrong. You're going to probably live to 100, which 
means you got 25 more years left. 
15:04 
So you better get back to work. There are 14 hot areas of research 
15:13 
into what we call the mechanism of aging. Looking at why we age. 
15:20 
And in fact, one of them is Senolytics. Senolytics, you heard Aviv. 
15:25 
I'm here to talk about. In fact, it's the harvesting of old cells that make your neighbor old. 
15:32 
What happens? I'm picking on you. I'm sorry. What happens if you've got a piece of old rotten fruit? 
15:37 
A fruit bowl? What happens? The rest of the fruit, it gets rotten, right? You had a bunch of neighbors 
help you. That's a good policy. 
15:44 
In fact, that's what happens with your body. We have old cells now. 
15:51 
When do we first get old cells? When we're actually, You're right! It's before we're born. In utero, but 
our immune system gets rid of them 
16:00 
till about age 30. At age 30, we start not to have the immune system get rid of them. 
16:06 
But in fact, you can do a project where you donate blood this way. 
16:11 
It's called therapeutic plasma exchange. This lady donates her blood, she gets her red 
16:18 
cells back, washed, she the plasma gets thrown away. That's those old proteins. 
16:25 
It's the cells those proteins make that makes you old. We think. And you get fresh plasma. 
16:31 
And guess what happens? This is the study if you want to Google it. It's the AMBAR studies. 
16:38 
Guess what happens? All you have to do is look in this panel here, the red is the people 
16:43 
who got it. The black is the people who didn't. Going up is better. Cognitive functions. It’s only thing 
we know that actually reverses Alzheimer's disease, 
16:51 
randomized controlled trials called AMBAR You can look it up Google, but that's getting rid of it. 
16:59 
We're at the early stage of it. You'd say, why don't we do it? Why isn't it now popular? 
17:05 
Because the company that sponsored it, which is the company that makes albumin, found out in this 
data analysis that saline did as well as albumin. 
17:15 
So they stopped doing the studies. So hopefully NIH will pick it up. 
Stem Cells
17:22 
There are a whole bunch you've heard about autophagy gene editing. One of the things that hyperbaric 
what we call hormetic hyperbaric 
17:32 
oxygen therapy, which is what you find at the Aviv Clinic does. And by the way, I have no relationship 
with Aviv, 
17:39 
although I'm here speaking and they let me come here. I didn't accept being on their scientific advisory 
board 
17:44 
because I wanted to be able to tell it to you without any bias at all. This thing works, but there are other
things. 
17:52 
Let me show you what telomeres are. Who's this lady? 
17:58 
That's Elizabeth Blackburn. She won the Nobel Prize for coming up with telomeres, rediscovering 
them 
18:03 
in 1994, and it's not showing. So I'll skip over that. 
18:09 
But in any case, what stem cells are is they're the matriarch of the body. 
18:15 
They produce everything. We learned that where they come from 
18:21 
is your spinal bones, if you will. The bones near your spine are the best for producing them. Now, 
18:30 
we learned why you get to a hospital fast after a heart attack or stroke. 
18:37 
It's not just to open up the blood flow to get marginal tissues back to normal. 
18:43 
That's what most of us thought until a few years. It's actually to open it up so that the exosomes in the 
cells 
18:51 
that are dying call forth your stem cells and you can rebuild. 
18:57 
We learned that when a male heart was transplanted into a female body and that male heart had a heart 
attack, 
19:06 
the ejection fraction, the amount of blood you inject after a heart attack goes down substantially. 
19:11 
It goes from about 65% down to about 30%. In a normal heart attack, 
19:17 
there is no normal heart attack in the usual heart attack. But guess what? 
19:23 
If you get to the hospital soon and you open up blood supply, your stem cells from your bone marrow, 
if you have them 
19:30 
and haven't wasted them, come to the heart. And then over a six week period they grow in the more 
heart cells 
19:38 
and you back to pumping at 65%. That's what we learned because when that heart 
19:45 
had the heart attack, it was the female person's stem cells. 
19:50 
You can tell that by looking at the chromosomes, it was the female person's stem cells that repaired it. 
19:57 
So the problem is most of us have a limit on stem cells. 
20:02 
Did you ever get sunburn when you were young? - Absolutely. - You wasted your g**damn stem cells. 
20:08 
Because what happens is whenever you have an injury, you have stem cells run to it. 
20:14 
But we only get 70 to 110 stem cells out of each one of our native stem cells. 
20:20 
So we're wasting them, if you will, and we run out of them. Well, the Aviv process makes more, but 
20:29 
the telomere is something that gets shortened every time we have a duplicate action. 
20:34 
So you get shorter and shorter and shorter telomeres. Well, the great news is you can build them up. 
20:40 
Maybe. So this is a drug that may do the same thing. 
20:47 
This is the end, the telomeres, that end of your chromosome, and it gets lengthened. 
20:52 
And guess what? When it gets lengthened, I'm going to give you another example of it. 
20:59 
At Stanford, they took I think it was 18 people, right, 18 people who had a stroke and had no function 
21:09 
on one side of their body, meaning they couldn't move their arm or leg for six years or more. 
21:16 
So this is 18 people. They took some stem cells from them in their bone marrow, 
21:22 
used some drugs, grew them in culture, and then injected them into that area. 
21:28 
And seven of them now got total recovery. 
21:34 
That's you get to repair yourself and what does it is your stem cells. 
21:40 
So just imagine if you have it. You could have, and by the way, these are things that change your stem 
cells. 
21:48 
So stress shortens it. People regularly meditate longer, telomeres, people who regularly have friends 
have longer telomeres. 
21:55 
People who regulate sugar laden and processed food have shortened telomeres. People regularly eat 
healthy have longer telomeres. 
22:03 
People who regularly do extreme physical activity have shorter telomeres. Don't do a marathon. People 
regularly do moderate 
22:09 
physical activity, have longer telomeres. Walk that 10,000 steps. Astronauts have shorter telomeres. 
22:15 
People who have sun burns or smoke or vape have shorter telomeres. People have short sleep times 
shorter telomeres. 
22:22 
People who regularly sleep six and a half to 8 hours have longer telomeres. People who regularly have 
sex have longer telomeres. 
22:29 
We understand that something that is done regularly here, The Villages. (laughter) 
22:35 
So be careful how you look at each other. Well, here is 
Telome
22:43 
if you had seen this couple in the front row, you would say they're there. They're not going to be here 
very long. 
22:50 
They're running home. (laughter) So anyway, you're going to learn about telomere elongation. 
22:58 
And in fact, that's one of the things that Aviv does really well. Just imagine if you had it, you could 
repair every part of your body, 
23:08 
young heart, young brain, young cartilage, young skin, young eyes, young gut, etc.. 
23:15 
That's the promise of getting more telomeres. And you've already got it here. 
23:20 
That's right. Let me go back on that one just to show you, 
23:26 
since you've got it here and the rest of us are envious of it. 
23:39 
So low oxygen is the greatest stimulant for stem cell reproduction. 
23:45 
What's the problem? Well, oxygen kills you. But if you can trick the body 
23:50 
into thinking it has low oxygen, you get longer telomeres. 
23:56 
And that's what the hyperbaric hormetic hyperbaric or the paradoxically 
24:01 
hypoxic stem cell proliferation that Aviv Clinic does. Okay. 14 areas. 
24:08 
I'm going to show you one more of the areas. One crazy thing. So at UC San Francisco, 
24:16 
they looked at every drug approved the FDA with the new IBM quantum computer. 
24:21 
I can say that because the new IBM Quantum computer is located at the Cleveland Clinic and what 
they find 
24:27 
they look for, does any drug block the attachment of amyloid 
24:33 
and TAO to your brain neurons and they found a drug that did it, Bumetanide 
24:39 
which is a $4 a month water pill. It's largely been replaced by Lasix or hydrochlorothiazide, 
24:46 
but it's approved by the FDA and is generic. They then looked at that in a mouse model of Alzheimer's 
disease 
24:53 
and it totally blocked the development of Alzheimer's disease in the mouse. 
24:59 
They then looked at it in two large databases, a 1.8 million person database at UC San Francisco, 3.8 
million in ours 
25:07 
And what they find is 70 and 72% reduction in dementia of all kinds. 
25:16 
What are we saying? It's the damaged protein that is amyloid or TAO that attaches to the neurons, that 
causes 
25:24 
inflammation, that kills your neurons and causes dementia? If you block that damaged protein from 
attaching, maybe you can block it. 
25:33 
That's what they think the theory is or the hypothesis is. It's now undergoing randomized controlled 
trial. 
25:39 
That's what's happening in medicine. We are advancing it fast enough so that maybe we'll be able to 
25:46 
some of the devastating diseases. Let me go back to the aging mechanism. My favorite, other than 
telomere 
25:54 
elongation, is epigenetic reprograming. You've heard a little bit about that. 
25:59 
What is epigenetic programing? Well, your epi genes remember the switches that control of your genes 
26:06 
are on and over time your epi genes get damaged, your epi genes are out in the cell as well as the 
cytoplasm. 
26:13 
They go between the two. Your genes stay really protected in your nucleus, so your epi genes or what 
they have gets damaged 
26:21 
and when you replace them by turning on four genes, we have the repair system 
26:29 
for almost everything in our body. And when you turn on these four genes, you repair 
26:36 
your epi genes back to the way they were when you were an 18 year old. Can you remember your 18 
year old? 
26:43 
Okay, so repair it back to the energy you had, the vitality, you had, everything else you had when you 
were 18. 
26:49 
When given to the old mice. It makes them young. Their spleen, their skin. 
26:54 
everything, their brain, their muscle. Older wide therapy, pancreas, muscle, all back to normal. 
27:03 
And they live about 50% longer. What was the problem? The problem in this was that when you turn 
on all four of these genes, 
27:12 
20% of the mice develop a cancer within the equivalent of two human years. 
27:17 
So it never went anywhere until about three years ago when it was discovered by the same group 
27:23 
and by the way, the guy who discovered the whole process is Yamanaka. He got the Nobel Prize for his 
work. 
27:30 
But now six labs have discovered that if you only turn on three of these genes, you don't turn on c-Myc,
27:37 
You get the young mouse, the young dog, 
27:42 
the young rat. It's just moving into human trials now, but you get young all over again. 
27:50 
And so there are many of these processes. There are 14 of them, but you've got one that's actually 
working now 
27:57 
in that place at the Advanced Center for Health Care. 
28:03 
So I'm going to skip a bunch of things because I'm running out of time, so don't worry about it other 
than you are genetic engineer for you. 
28:12 
And I'm going to skip some of these just to show you things you can do. 
28:19 
If I can go fast enough. So any of you, by the way, you're welcome to have the slides, 
28:26 
whoever you contact at Aviv Clinics will give you the slides. But there are 40 things that have been 
shown 
28:33 
in at least two studies in humans that change your rate of aging of your brain in a prospective way. 
28:40 
And so I'm going to go over a few of them. One of them is immunizations. So this is a flu shot. 
28:47 
These are this is the third of the studies. If you had no flu shots for some reason, there it is. 
28:55 
If you had no flu shots, you had a 40% increase in dementia over the five years compared to 
29:03 
if you have gotten a flu shot every year after age. I think it's 65. 
29:09 
So one of the reasons to get a flu shot to prevent dementia. Why? 
29:14 
Because the flu causes enormous inflammation and inflammation 
29:20 
is what destroys our neurons after something bad attaches to them. Another one is do four 
29:26 
components of physical activity and speed of processing games. What are the four of physical activity? 
29:33 
Well, one that you heard already about. I'm sorry, I'm going. This is 10,000 steps a day and yes, 
29:40 
4000 steps is better than 2000. And 6000 is better than 4000. 
29:46 
But 10,000 is the ideal point. It doesn't matter whether you're a man or woman, doesn't matter your age,
doesn't matter your ethnicity. 
29:54 
And if you wanted to prevent brain dysfunction, 10,000, that's the upper panel on the left here is idea of
10,000 steps a day. 
30:03 
It came from a Japanese pedometer manufacturer who was just trying to sell pedometers, 
30:09 
(laughter) but maybe he knew what the hell he was talking about because he was right. 
Speed of Processing
30:15 
So remember, you get to control your genes when you do speed of processing games, 
30:21 
when you injure a muscle, what happens? You lift a weight, you tear it a little, it sends out a repair. 
30:28 
You're turning on a repair gene that says, I'm building that muscle stronger. And that's what happens. 
When you jump, 
30:36 
you cause a small fracture in your hipbone and guess what? You repair it stronger. 
30:42 
That is, it's a microfracture and you turn on a gene that repairs your hip bone. Same thing with your 
brain. 
30:48 
When you do speed of processing games, we now know you turn on a gene, you injure the nerve a little
bit, 
30:55 
but you turn on a gene that repairs it and it keeps your memory stronger. You want to know the name, 
you can impress someone for you at the next cocktail party. 
31:04 
You can say, What's NPAS4? No one will know it. Bet them on it because there is the repair gene for 
your brain's functioning. 
Smells
31:14 
You are a genetic engineer. For you, I'm in red. Am I? Over time. 
31:19 
Okay. Four smells a day. I'm going to go quickly. 2 minutes. Four smells a day, prevents dementia 
31:27 
and reverses it in two randomized controlled trials. So coffee, garlic, onions, alcohol, whatever four 
smells 
31:36 
you want, that does it. But it has to be intentional. Hearing aids prevent dementia, get them 
Coffee
31:44 
If you have hard of hearing. If your wife tells you you're hard of hearing, get the hearing aids. 
31:49 
She's right. Okay, guys. Yeah. What black coffee also does it. 
31:55 
That's why I take it on stage and I'm going to do a couple more if I can. 
32:04 
Extra virgin olive oil, half a tablespoon a day prevents it. 
32:10 
And if you will, it is keeping your proteins young. 
32:15 
And we would go one more slide. I think maybe two. Five tips for you. 
Summary
32:22 
Change your attitude. You are a genetic engineer for you. 
32:27 
What you do today matters whether you walk or not, matters whether you have a steak versus salmon 
matters, 
32:36 
how much sugar you have matters. Only eat food you love and that loves you back. 
32:42 
Food is like a marriage. You wouldn't marry someone who is trying to kill you every day, would you? 
You shouldn't eat food that's trying to kill you every day. 
32:51 
Choose a team. None of us can do this alone. There you are. You guys are so God darn lucky you've got
Aviv here. 
32:58 
Not only do they do the hyperbaric, but they do everything surrounding it in that list of 40 things 
33:06 
Add speed to your body and brain, smells, coffee and olive oil and manage stress. 
33:12 
Meet your neighbors because cultivating your posse and passion and play are key. 
33:18 
You get a lot of play and posse here so cultivate passions as well. Thank you very much and I'm sorry 
I'm over
