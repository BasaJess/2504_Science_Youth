## Proof of Concept (PoC):
---

Objective: Extract the latest reliable scientific findings to extend human healthspan, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models or any other ML methods. Extract meaningful relationships between specific kewywords, approved drugs, and interventions and filter the results from Noise and unfounded or commercial interest.​ Finaly present for Public access in the Web. 

1. Introduction & Problem Statement:
There’s growing interest in longevity research, but manually sifting through vast amounts of scientific papers is time-consuming. According to experts in the field, nowadays there is a scientific paper on regards to this topic published every 20 min. Additionally there are many commercial interests and more and more Dietary Supplements Companies claim to have found the fountain of youth to sell their products. Finally there are news outlets publishing stories related to this topic but without providing new or fundamented information. 

Thus a quick Broswer or ChatGPT search does not give good results, an automated system that retrieves and analyzes scientific articles on human longevity and extracts relevant insights using NLP is of great help for the people interested.

2. Scope:
In an initial Iteration we will limit the dataset to a recognized Public Scientific Database, taking only around 1000 PDF documents, later more Databases can be included.
The book "Lifespan" by Dr. David Sinlcair in PDF form can also be used as a trainning or reference source.

3. Solution Overview

Our system uses arvix.org API to gather research articles, then processes them with NLP models to summarize findings and extract key terms.
 - Data Acquisition: For the first 3 days 1000 PDF Scientific papers will be collected and stored in an AWS Bucket using a list of 69 related Keywords to find a subset of abstracts focusing on lifespan extension studies.​

**
Technology Stack: Briefly mention the tools and technologies you used, such as PubMed API, Python (for data processing), spaCy (for NLP), Hugging Face (for summarization), and Plotly (for visualization).

3. Demonstration
Walk Through the System: Show how the PoC works. If possible, provide a live demo, or walk through a set of results on a screen.

Start with retrieving a set of articles (show a sample query and results).

Show how the system processes and cleans the data.

Display the insights extracted (e.g., summary, key terms, sentiment, trends).

Visualize the insights (e.g., keyword frequency, topic modeling).

Results and Output: Present the outcomes of your PoC—what insights were extracted and how they were visualized. Show charts, word clouds, or summarized texts that highlight key findings.

4. Technical Details
Data Pipeline: Show how the data flows from retrieval (e.g., PubMed API), through preprocessing (e.g., NLP tasks), to final insights. This can be shown with a flow diagram or a simple walkthrough of the code.

Key Algorithms Used: Highlight the algorithms and models used (e.g., Named Entity Recognition, Topic Modeling, Summarization), and why they were chosen.

Challenges Faced: Mention any challenges you encountered during development, such as extracting text from PDFs or fine-tuning NLP models, and how you overcame them.

5. Results & Impact
Proof of Concept Validation: Demonstrate how your PoC works as intended. For example, "Our system correctly identifies the most mentioned keywords in longevity research and can summarize complex research papers in under 10 seconds."

Potential Impact: Discuss how this system could scale or be expanded. For example, "This PoC could be expanded to cover more databases and analyze a broader range of topics in scientific literature."

6. Next Steps & Roadmap
Future Development: Discuss the next steps for your project. What could be improved? For example:

Scale the system to retrieve articles from multiple databases.

Add more advanced NLP capabilities like sentiment analysis or deeper summarization.

Automate the generation of personalized reports based on user interests.

Scalability & Integration: If applicable, mention how your PoC could be scaled or integrated with other systems.

7. Q&A / Feedback
Open the floor for questions and feedback. Be prepared to answer technical questions about your approach and the tools you used, as well as the potential impact of the PoC.
