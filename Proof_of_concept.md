## Proof of Concept (PoC):
---

Objective: Extract the latest reliable scientific findings to extend human healthspan, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models or any other ML methods. Extract meaningful relationships between specific kewywords, approved drugs, and interventions and filter the results from Noise and unfounded or commercial interest.​ Finaly present for Public access in the Web. 

#### 1. Introduction & Problem Statement:
There’s growing interest in longevity research, but manually sifting through vast amounts of scientific papers is time-consuming. According to experts in the field, nowadays there is a scientific paper on regards to this topic published every 20 min. Additionally there are many commercial interests and more and more Dietary Supplements Companies claim to have found the fountain of youth to sell their products. Finally there are news outlets publishing stories related to this topic but without providing new or fundamented information. 

Thus a quick Broswer or ChatGPT search does not give good results, an automated system that retrieves and analyzes scientific articles on human longevity and extracts relevant insights using NLP is of great help for the people interested.

#### 2. Scope:
In an initial Iteration we will limit the dataset to a recognized Public Scientific Database, taking only around 1000 PDF documents, later more Databases can be included.
The book "Lifespan" by Dr. David Sinlcair in PDF form can also be used as a trainning or reference source.

#### 3. Solution Overview

 - Our system will use first arvix.org API to gather research articles, then processes them with NLP models to summarize findings and extract key terms.
 - Data Acquisition: For the first 3 days 1000 PDF Scientific papers will be collected and stored in an AWS Bucket using a list of 69 related Keywords to find a subset of abstracts focusing on lifespan extension studies.​
 - Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text data from pulled abstracts.​
 - NLP Implementation: Utilize transformer models (e.g., BERT) to extract entities such as gene therapy, known drugs extending healthspan, genetic pathways and other keywords from the text. Perhaps identify and classify relationships between these entities based on co-occurrence and contextual analysis.
 - Knowledge Graph Construction: If possible we will use tools like Neo4j or NetworkX to visualize the extracted relationships.​ Ensure the graph effectively represents connections between genes, pathways, drugs, and interventions.​
 - Evaluation:Assess the accuracy of entity extraction and relationship identification.Validate the knowledge graph's coherence and its alignment with existing scientific literature.​


#### 4. Demonstration ( to be done in the second and third day)

 - Retrieve one article (show a sample query and results).

 - Show how the system will processes and clean the data.

 - Display the insights extracted (e.g., summary, key terms, sentiment, trends).

 - Visualize the insights (e.g., keyword frequency, topic modeling).

 - Results and Output: Present the outcomes and what insights will be extracted and how they will be visualized. Charts, word clouds, or summarized texts that highlight key findings.

#### 5. Technical Details
 - Data Pipeline: Flow diagram or a simple walkthrough of the code.

 ***
 - Step 1. Data retrieval:

   - APIs for Scientific Articles:
     - PubMed API (For biomedical research)
     - arXiv API (open-access scientific papers)
     - Semantic Scholar API (wide range of research papers)
     - CrossRef API (DOI-based paper research)
  - Web Scraping
    - Use Scrapy or BeautifulSop for open-access journals.
    - Check on permissions and legal use.
 - Step 2. Preprocessing and Storage:

   - Convert PDFs to text using pdfminer or PyMuPDF.
   - Clean data (keep references, figures, etc.)
   - Store in a structured format (maybe use a AWS or Azure Database)
 - Step 3. NLP for Information Extraction:

   - Named Entity Recognition. Identify key terms like “Telomere length”, “Epigenetics”, MTor, etc
   - Summarization. Use transformers (BART, T5 or Pegasus) to generate summaries.
   - Keyword Extraction. Use TF-IDF, YAKE, or KeyBERT to highlight main topics.
   - Relation Extraction: Train a model to detect causal links (e.g. “finding extends healthspan”)
 - Step 4. Analysis and Insights:

   - Use vector databases (FAISS, ChromaDB) for semantic search.
   - Build a chatbot or dashboard to query the findings inside a live website.

 - Key Algorithms Used: Algorithms and models used (e.g., Named Entity Recognition, Topic Modeling, Summarization), and why they were chosen.

 - Challenges Faced: Mention any challenges you encountered during development, such as extracting text from PDFs or fine-tuning NLP models, and how you overcame them.

#### 6. Results & Impact
 - Proof of Concept Validation: "Our system correctly identifies the most mentioned keywords in longevity research and can summarize complex research papers in under 10 seconds."
 - Potential Impact: "This PoC could be expanded to cover more databases and analyze a broader range of topics in scientific literature."

#### 7. Next Steps & Roadmap
 - Scale the system to retrieve articles from multiple databases.
 - Add more advanced NLP capabilities like sentiment analysis or deeper summarization.
 - Automate the generation of personalized reports based on user interests.
 - Scalability & Integration: this system could be scaled or integrated with other systems.
